# Software Development

## Unit 3, lesson 3

In this task, you will be provided with an Express.js project that has the following

* __index.js__ - A simple node js server file which runs in port 8080
* __views/index.ejs__ - An HTML template file to render a simple web page

In this project, we are using a package called "ejs" which allows node js to response HTML files, just like a website.
However, using Node JS, we can modify the content in the HTML dynamically. This is why we call it an HTML "template".

in the index.ejs file, we have a space with a variable in line 16. We can pass a value to this variable and change the data in the page.
Check the example in index.js and see how it render the page with a "Hello World" message by passing that value.

### How to run the app

open the terminal and go to the project folder

Install the packages
`npm install`

Run the app
`node index.js`

Now open the browser and go to http://localhost:8080



Your instructor will provide you with more information about the task.
